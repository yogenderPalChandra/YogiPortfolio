  "Projec_1": "To stream the real time in-situ energy disbursement from grid to load. we introduced a novel data layer along with custom-made exergetic models. To fit the entropy generation equation correctly to the tailored data layer, the equation was rederived to capture the spontaneity of the physical process  The data layer consists of two Raspberry Pi (Raspi1 & Raspi2) computers, both running on Raspbian – Debian Linux operating system. Raspi1 stores temperature data from 19 PT-100 sensors located at various locations of the test bench, while Raspi2 stores the flow rate data, all in real time. PT-100 are Resistance Temperature Detector (RTD) sensors. When it comes to precision temperature measurement, nothing beats RTDs. RTDs have a resistor most commonly made of platinum, copper, nickel alloys, or various metal oxides that changes its resistance as the temperature is changed. Most commonly, temperature measurement device, or a calibrator is used to convert this resistance back to temperature values according to the conversion table of that RTD type. We used Adafruit sensor amplifier - MAX31865 for this purpose (Adafruit & Industries, n.d.). We used this type of converter to make sure that all the RTD sensors are calibrated at the same level, thus experimental accuracy and data analysis is not compromised. This conversion is automatically done in ALMEMO type of Data systems, however ALMEMO devices don’t provide the flexibility of real time data evaluation. The flow data reaching Raspi2s GPIOs (general purpose input output) is in the form of analog current loop (4-20 mA) which is type of output interface of many industrial sensors and since Raspberry Pis GPIOs are designed to read digital signal, these analog current loop signals are first converted to digital equivalent using an industrial analog to digital (ADC) converter and then connected to Raspi2s GPIO to read in. Subsequently, this digital value has to be linearly regressed to the actual physical value using intercept equation of line and finally calibrated with what is visible on the flow meter readout. This is done each 5 th second the data is logged into each of the Raspis PostgreSQL-DBs tables through simple one-liner code (Chandra, [GitHub code], 2021). In addition, a short code snippet running in Raspi1 also fetches wattmeter readings via. Modbus RTU RS-485 serial protocol (Figure 2(b) wattmeter). Modbus RTU is widely used within building management systems (BMS) and industrial automation systems (IAS) due to the simplicity of its architecture of 16-bit hexadecimal registers which can pack and parse floating point, ASCII, tables and other structured data. Modbus registers primarily uses RS-485 serial interface for master/slave communication which is highly flexible and supported by nearly every commercial data acquisition, monitoring and control programs. Wattmeter stores the 3-phase electricity consumption of HP in kWh in Modbus registers, where it can be accessed using RTU-485 serial interface protocol.  Furthermore, since the temperature and flow rate data are stored in different PostgreSQL servers running on different machines, Raspi1 remotely accesses Raspi2’s PostgreSQL tables to fetch its data in a while loop while both are clocked together. This makes sure that all the data (temperature and flow) is stamped with the same time frame. This makes Raspi1 as the main server to perform all the important task including, data transformation, data cleaning, equation fitting etc. Furthermore, to assist the data workflow, intelligence and visualization Raspi1 also exhibits the Jupyter-Lab server. Jupyter-Lab or Jupyter notebook is web based interactive development and configuration environment to support wide range of data science, scientific computing, machine learning, and deep learning workflows. In addition, attractive feature Jupyter notebook proposes is that it can easily be run in the web browsers – this makes working with Raspberry Pi based data acquisition systems which are characteristically headless (no visual display computer monitors), extremely convenient, and accessible remotely (Jupyter-Lab, n.d.). In addition, since Raspberry Pis system are headless, the first hand visual of the data is missing in any case of overheating and potential accident, To add second level security and monitoring, Raspi1 also retains Flask server which is constantly logging the data on web-based application server available anywhere outside of localhost for a quick overview of any outliers and potential damage control & remedy since we aredealing with HP with missing visual perspective whatsoever (Chandra, Sensor Data, n.d.). Flask is a portable micro web framework written in Python (Flask-documentation, n.d.). The code for Flask application is written in Python and is open and freely available to be copied, transferred and used on our GitHub repository.  The whole workflow is depicted in the Figure 2.",

  "re": "An efficient storage retains thermal stratification and improves the discharging performance. Turbulentmixing between hot and cold water is the prime source of stratification destruction. In this paperquantification of turbulent missing was achieved on the basis of temperature profile, MIX number, andRichardson number. The evaluated parameters includeflow rate,DT, and diffuser design, henceforth adirect interdependence between each was thus established. Various CFD models were developed andexperimentally validated on the test rig in order tofind the optimal working conditions in dischargemode. The results proved numerically that the tank working conditions can be optimized by properselection of inlet device. For instance, slotted type inlet device sustained maximum stratification even inas adverse a condition as of turbulent inflow&lowDT.Perforated and simple inlet devices were capableof delivering best discharge efficiency only at lowflow rate of 200 l/h and were showing insignificantdependency onDT. However, asflow rate is increased,DTdependency increased. Seeing the com-pounded benefits of slotted inlet devices and decreasedDT, it was concluded that slotted inlet devicedelivered comparatively better thermal performance at both adverse conditions i.e. highflow&lowDTand highflow&highDT, however, failed to outshine the rest of the inlet devices at lowflow rate&lowDT, and lowflow rate&highDT. These researchfindings can serve as guidelines to optimize the storagetank designemore specifically, inlet device based design integrated with heating system, as thermalstratification and COP of heating systemeheat pumps, for example, are inherently correlated. Heatpumps are highflow rate and lowDTdevices, while, solar systems are lowflow rate and highDTdevices,Thus, opting for accurate choice of inlet device for a particular operating condition is critica",
  "eb": "To assure high quality thermal storage and high efficiency of its acquisition, thermal stratification is often employed in domestic hot water tanks. The whole motivation of stratification lies in the fact that mixing effect can be minimized during operational cycle of the tank so that high temperature water could be taken at the load end, thus maintaining high thermal efficiency at demand side, while low-temperature water can be drawn at lower bottom, thus maintaining the high efficiency at energy collection side. The study of stratification entails the assessment of a wide variety of concepts to be embodied around the central theme of the tank –its design and modelling. This paper presents a systematic review pertaining to various such concepts . For instance, multi-node and plug-flow approach to model various temperature distribution models are considered. These models are categorized in paper as linear, stepped, continuous- linear and general three-zone temperature distribution models. Subsequently, the dynamics of thermo- cline decay and influencing parameters both during standby and dynamic mode will be demonstrated. In addition, a survey of state of the art methods and practices to ascertain the performance improvement and its quantification will be illustrated. This includes geometrical parameters – such as, structural design incorporation, essentially –inlet design, tank aspect ratio and wall material specification, and also, oper- ational parameters to curb down the inlet mixing. Practice techniques and methods which are presented here in a novel way, extend towards the ground of practical application and research procedures",
  "se": "Two type of receiver systems currently employed in solar parabolic trough collector technology are evac-uated annuli receivers and air filled annuli receivers. While former receiver finds its way into high-temperature grid-acquaintance solar parabolic trough collectors, latter are more inclined towards non-grid solar thermal applications like low-temperature process heat. Evacuated receivers utilize vacuumfilled annuli to reduce down the convection losses; this makes them substantially expensive – while priz-ing them as benchmark among receivers. Contrary, air filled annuli based receivers are relatively lessexpensive but are sub-par in thermal performance relative to evacuated receivers. This work deals withthe air filled receiver system and would try to abridge the economy and efficiency between both types ofsystems using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based numerical simulation approach. A heat blockingthermal insulation was tailored and fitted in the sun facing receiver annulus which does not receive con-centrated radiation of the Sun, and was simulated for the reduction in convective losses and for favour-able circumferential temperature distribution (CTD) around the absorber. Consequently, its convectiveheat losses were investigated for varying wind speeds and mass flow rates of heat transfer fluid (HTF)and were compared with mainstream air filled annuli receivers. Simulation results are compared withexperimentation in which wind velocity was in a range of 0.43–4.99 m/s. It has been found that glassenvelope temperature decreases with increase in wind velocity which directly insinuates the decreasein convection losses around glass envelope. These comparative implications could be served as a pointof reference to develop solar parabolic trough collector for small scale process heat applications in India"
